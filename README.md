# gptproject

This is a work-in-progress reconstruction of a basic version of chatgpt. 
There are files following the multiple stages and exercises I followed in order to develop these models,
most of which followed the Andre Kaparthy youtube tutorials. The end goal is to understand and be able to apply LLM technology 
to other personal projects.
